# python-api-challenge

This project looks at weather patterns in different cities and helps find ideal vacation spots based on specific conditions. 
WeatherPy: Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to gather weather data for over 500 cities and analyze how latitude affects temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
VacationPy: Uses the Geoapify API to find hotels in cities that meet ideal vacation weather conditions.

Based on the results, the conclusions below:
- Cities closer to the equator are generally warmer, while those farther away tend to be colder.
- Humidity and cloudiness don’t show a strong pattern with latitude, meaning other factors like geography and climate zones have a bigger impact.
- Wind speeds vary but tend to be lower in some higher latitude areas, possibly due to terrain or atmospheric conditions.
-The final vacation map highlights ideal cities with good weather, and the hotel search feature helps find a place to stay nearby.
